00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I'm not sure if I'm right.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
Wow.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
What an audience.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
But if I'm being honest, I don't care what you think of my talk.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
I don't.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
I care what the internet thinks of my talk.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Because they're the ones who get it seen and get it shared.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
And I think that's where most people get it wrong.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
They're talking to you, here.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
Instead of talking to you, random person scrolling Facebook.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Thanks for the click.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
You see, back in 2009, we all had these weird little things called attention spans.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Yeah, they're gone.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
They're gone.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
We killed them.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
They're dead.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
I'm trying to think of the last time I watched an 18-minute TED talk.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
It's been years, literally years.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
So if you're given a TED talk, keep it quick.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
I'm doing mine in under a minute.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I'm at 44 seconds right now.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
That means we've got time for one final joke.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
Why are balloons so expensive?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Inflation.

01:07.000 --> 01:27.000
Thank you.
